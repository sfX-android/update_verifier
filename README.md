# Usage

## Verifying Build Authenticity

You can verify whether a build has been signed with our keys with this command:

`python update_verifier.py XXX_pubkey /path/to/zip`

(obviously replace *XXX_pubkey* with the public key file and */path/to/zip* with the path to the zip you want to verify)

If the script reports **verified successfully**, the ZIP file signature is valid.

For the paranoid, the contents of this page are stored on our GitHub.
